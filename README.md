# Login-with-Apple-Firebase-SwiftUI
A SwiftUI component which handles logging in with Apple to Firebase

Under development. I'm hoping this will a great template/boilerplate code.


You need a GoogleService-Info.plist file to compile. Go through the setup process on Firebase

You also need to have Cocopods and run `pod install`
