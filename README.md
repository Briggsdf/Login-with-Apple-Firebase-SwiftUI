# Login with Apple Firebase SwiftUI

I made this SwiftUI component to handle logging in with Apple to Firebase.

# Demo Gif







# Setup

 1. Copy the entirety of the `SignInWithAppleToFirebase` folder to your repo. https://github.com/joehinkle11/Login-with-Apple-Firebase-SwiftUI/tree/master/LoginWithAppleFirebaseSwiftUI/SignInWithAppleToFirebase
 2. Add Firebase to your project https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup?authuser=0
 3. Make sure you open the Xcode workspace generated by Cocopods (this is detailed in the Firebase tutorial in step 2)
 4. Add Sign In with Apple to your app's id configuration at https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list
Remove
 5. Add Sign in with Apple to your project's capabilities
 6. Add the `SignInWithAppleToFirebase` button to your view
 7. Now when users click on the button, it will sign them into Firebase using sign in with Apple
 
# Gotchas

 - You need a GoogleService-Info.plist file to compile this codebase. Go through the setup process on Firebase
 - You also need to have Cocopods and run `pod install`
